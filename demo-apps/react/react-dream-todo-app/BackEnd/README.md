# What is Moonshine?

___Moonshine___ was primarily made to replace two of the most frequently used apps on my machine but with time I realised I needed a little more feature-packed project. But before I tell you more about it, here are some screenshots:

To start-off, it was supposed to replace just two apps:

1. A browser extension that shows an inspirational quote, the current time and has a beautiful image background, and

2. Obsidian - Which I used to plan the next day, every night.

As I started to build this, I realised I needed more than just a todo. I encountered two problems and incorporated the solutions for them in Moonshine itself:

- For tasks that needed me to send reminder to a friend, I had to pick up my phone and send a Whatsapp message ( I usually keep my phone away when I'm working, so this was like sending invitation to delightful distractions, which needless to say, was not something I wanted to do). 
> Solution: _I used __Novu__ to incorporate just the feature I wanted: Send reminders to my friends on their phone about a certain task._


-  Now the friends reminder thing was sorted out but what if that friend was a work collegue. I couldn't send them phone reminders as that would make me seem pushy and I couldn't just ignore urgent work related matters as well! So I created another workaround:
> Solution: _I leveraged another feature of __Novu__ to send email reminders on their mail address. This way I was able to send them reminders (and having the mental peace) and not seem like I was trying to push work related tasks._

## Run locally

Runs the app in the development mode.

Make sure you also complete the set up for environment variables listed below, as without it, the app won't run! üëá
